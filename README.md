## Description

This application is a book search engine. I have built it using MERN including graphql databases. This application will allow you to search for desired books. Also, you can log in to search for books and save them to a list that you can later revisit. The books can also be deleted from your list. I used MERN and graphql to make a more efficient search engine. In the future I would like to create a more polished UI. The books returned are in different sizes which makes it look unpolished.
